                            <h3>Title: In Her Shoes (2002)</h3>
                            <h3>Author: Jennifer Weiner</h3>
                            <p>Synopsis: From Jennifer Weiner comes a story of two sisters 
                            with nothing in common but a love for shoes learn they are more 
                            alike than they thought possible.</p>
                            
                            <p>Meet Rose Feller, a thirty-year-old high-powered attorney with 
                            a secret passion for romance novels. She has an exercise regime 
                            she's going to start next week, and she dreams of a man who will 
                            slide off her glasses, gaze into her eyes, and tell her she's beautiful. 
                            She also dreams of getting her fantastically screwed-up, semi-employed 
                            little sister to straighten up and fly right.</p>
                            
                            <p>Meet Rose's sister, Maggie. Twenty-eight years old and drop-dead 
                            gorgeous. Although her big-screen stardom hasn't progressed past 
                            her left hip's appearance in a Will Smith video, Maggie dreams of 
                            fame and fortune -- and of getting her big sister on a skin-care regimen.</p>
                            
                            <p>These two women, who claim to have nothing in common but a childhood 
                            tragedy, DNA, and the same size feet, are about to learn that they're more 
                            alike than they'd ever imagined. Along the way, they'll encounter a diverse 
                            cast of characters -- from a stepmother who's into recreational Botox to a 
                            disdainful pug with no name. They'll borrow shoes and clothes and boyfriends, 
                            and eventually make peace with their most intimate enemies -- each other.</p>
